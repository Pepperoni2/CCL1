## **Reflection**
### What went well:
- **Creative design**: creating various images and sprites (enemies, backgrounds, icons, weapons, etc.).
- **Learning new tools**: I learned how to do pixel art and explored new art tools like Aseprite and Libresprite along the way.
- **Discussing ideas**: It was a lot of fun discussing potential additions to the game with my colleagues. Overall, it was an interesting and enjoyable project to work on.

### Challenges: 
-  **Electric Field weapon**: Managing, and setting cooldowns, durations and intervals, I also focused on early difficulty, hit radius, and timing
-  **Game balancing**: Balancing the game, scaling enemies, and creating upgrades to enhance gameplay were key components of my work
 
### Lessons learned:
- **Solid foundation**: Building a solid foundation is really helpful, especially for later if other more complex will be added to the game.
- **Keep it Simple**: Focusing on one unique mechanic instead of multiple features made the game more polished and compact.
